For that reason, data exploration is the first step undertaken here. A quick review of the data revealed a slight imbalance between the boolean Outcome column. The true-false ratio is 66:34.\n","\n","There is also a lack of null or NaN values. However, the dataset is missing values in the form of zeros in the BMI, SkinThickness, BloodPressure, Glucose columns. From a medical perspective, these data points should rarely or never equal zero leading to the conclusion that data is absent.\n","\n","There is also little correlation between the features.

Using a defined task, an AutoML package performs rapid training on a number of models that perform generally well on the task and compare the performance on a number of metrics, primarily accuracy. For this to work, AutoML makes a number of assumptions and decisions that would normally be explicitly coded by an expert. The trade-off is rapid and easy comparison of models for lack of control. For this reason, experts who require a high level of control over the parameters of their model might choose other solutions, or start with AutoML but produce custom code for production.

trade-offs. The use of AutoML drastically speeds up model selection and experimentation. It produced detailed evaluation results and PyCaret comes with an intuitive output interface that allows users to explore different aspects of the models' evaluation to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the models' performance. This enables users to make a more informed model selection decision. The tool also allows for rapid experimentation. It is a powerful tool for machine learning workflows.\n","\n","On the other hand, AutoML makes decisions and assumptions for the user. This makes it a less ideal choice in situations where users need to prioritize certain aspects of model performance such as to maximize the precision instead of pure accuracy. There are features of AutoML that allow further control than the basic implementation. However, they do not have same level of flexibility as other popular options. In conclusion, AutoML is a powerful tool that naturally includes trade-offs."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb929902fb47c2bb","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"cb929902fb47c2bb"},"source":["### Citations\n","\n","[1] J.
